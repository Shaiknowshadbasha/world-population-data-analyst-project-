INTRODUCTION :

The objective of this project is to analyze historical world population data and predict
future population trends. Understanding population dynamics is crucial for planning and
policy-making in various sectors such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the United Nations World Population
Prospects and includes features such as year, birth rate, death rate, net migration, fertility
rate, and population.
Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for analysis, we handled missing values by removing rows with NA
values. Additional features, such as the population growth rate, were created to enhance
the model's predictive power.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory analysis revealed significant trends in population growth over the years. Key
factors such as birth rate, death rate, and fertility rate were visualized to understand their
impact on population changes.
Model Building
A Linear Regression model was trained using the historical population data. The features
were scaled to ensure uniform contribution to the model, and the dataset was split into
training and testing sets.
Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 score.
The results showed a reasonable prediction accuracy, with the predicted population trends
closely following the actual data.
Results and Discussion

The analysis indicated that factors such as birth rate and fertility rate significantly influence
population growth. However, the model could be further improved by incorporating more
features and using advanced machine learning techniques.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the use of machine learning in analyzing and
predicting world population trends. Future work could involve exploring more sophisticated
models and considering additional demographic factors.
